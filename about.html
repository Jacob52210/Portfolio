                        My name is Jake and it's a pleasure to meet you! <br /> I am a father to 3 great kids and a loving husband for 10 years and counting.
                        My passions include Family Fun Fridays, motorcycles, camping, cooking, movies and video games. I am very family orientated and love spending time
                        with my wife and children. My wife and I married shortly after high school and started a family. I worked many good jobs and settled on a great 
                        factory job at PCA, but I wasn't passionate about what I did. So, I enrolled in Wagner College and furthered my technological education online.
                        I'm loving working from my home office and creating websites like you don't normally see.

                    <h6>Machine Operator, Clamp/Fork Truck Driver</h6>
                    <p>
                        At PCA, I've played many roles. I've operated machines, loaded and unloaded tractor trailers and rail cars. 
                        I have kept track of inventory, stocked the presses and corrugator. I was responsible for the quality of every machine I worked on.
                        I was on the PEO (Plant Emergency Organization) team as well as a union steward/rep. I was also part of multiple committees such as
                        the waste committee, the survey response team, and more.

                    <p>
                        At Pizza Hut, my title was server but that never stopped me from learning more. I was always helping with clean up, food prep, making pizzas
                        and the occasional customer complaint. I treated <b>EVERY</b> customer as if they were my own family and always made sure their food was
                        spot on, if not better, than what they were expecting. Working with customers has taught me patience and the importance of a quality product
                        in a timely manner. It was one of my regular customers that saw my potential and worth who got me a job at PCA.

                    <h6>Farms, Small Factories, Construction</h6>
                    <p>
                        Fresh outta high school, I shipped out for the United States Navy bootcamp in Chicago, IL but was let go before graduating due to a heart condition. 
                        I was proud to have gone as far as I did but was left without a back up plan. I immediately picked up odd jobs once I returned home. I've split wood, 
                        worked at multiple factories through temp agencies, did a little roofing and plumbing, etc... I was learning more skills and realizing the drive it 
                        requires to be successful in the real world. I learned to never give and never be too humble to work a job. Before long, I was hired at Pizza Hut as a server.

                    <h6>Computer Technologies, Science, English</h6>
                    <p>
                        At Red Creek Central School, I was blessed to have such a broad curriculum. Some of the areas I grew passionate about were English,
                        Science, Mathematics, sports, and above all else... Computer Technology. I was on the varsity wrestling team for all four years of high school.
                        I am comfortable working with a team but also know that I've got to succeed in my own area as well in order for my team to succeed. It was at
                        RCCS that I met the girl of my dreams. I was unsure of where I was headed in life, but I knew I wanted her by my side. In my Junior year, I enlisted
                        in the Navy through the Delayed Entry Program. In that one year, I was training with Navy Seals and traveling once a month to different locations
                        where I trained and prepared for what I thought was to become my new life...
