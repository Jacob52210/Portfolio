                    <h6>Machine Operator, Clamp/Fork Truck Driver</h6>
                    <p>
                        At PCA, I've played many roles. I've operated machines, loaded and unloaded tractor trailers and rail cars. 
                        I have kept track of inventory, stocked the presses and corrugator. I was responsible for the quality of every machine I worked on.
                        I was on the PEO (Plant Emergency Organization) team as well as a union steward/rep. I was also part of multiple committees such as
                        the waste committee, the survey response team, and more.

                    <h6>Server</h6>
                    <p>
                        At Pizza Hut, my title was server but that never stopped me from learning more. I was always helping with clean up, food prep, making pizzas
                        and the occasional customer complaint. I was opening the resteraunt some days, and closing it others. I treated <b>EVERY</b> customer as if they were my own family and always made sure their food was
                        spot on, if not better, than what they were expecting. Working with customers has taught me patience and the importance of a quality product
                        in a timely manner. It was one of my regular customers that saw my potential and worth who got me a job at PCA.

                    <p>
                        After being discharged from the Navy, I immediately found work doing odd jobs.
                        I've split wood, worked at multiple factories through temp agencies, did a little roofing and plumbing, etc... 
                        I was learning more skills and realizing the drive it requires to be successful in the real world. 
                        I learned to never give and never be too humble to work a job.

                    <p>
                        At Red Creek Central School, I was blessed to have such a broad curriculum. Some of the areas I grew passionate about were English,
                        Science, Mathematics, sports, and above all else... Computer Technology. I was on the varsity wrestling team for all four years of high school.
                        I am comfortable working with a team but also know that I've got to succeed in my own area as well in order for my team to succeed. 
                        In my Junior year, I enlisted in the Navy through the Delayed Entry Program. In that one year, I was training with Navy Seals and traveling 
                        once a month to different locations where I trained and prepared for what I thought was to become my new life...
