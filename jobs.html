						<h3>Hiatus - Coding Bootcamp</h3>
						<h6>Web Development & Programming</h6>
						<p>
							I am currently attending an online bootcamp called QuickStart Learning. At the moment, I have built 2
							basic business websites, a shopping app, a search engine calling an API and converting the JSON data to be
							displayed in my DOM, and this portfolio. At the moment, I am building websites and web applications, but I
							am also interested in learning how to develop software for computers and video games.

						<h3>Packaging Corp of America</h3>
						<h6>Machine Operator, Clamp/Fork Truck Driver</h6>
						<p>
							At PCA, I've played many roles. I've operated machines, loaded and unloaded tractor trailers and rail
							cars. I have kept track of inventory, stocked the presses and corrugator. I was responsible for the
							quality of every machine I worked on. I was on the PEO (Plant Emergency Organization) team as well as a
							union steward/rep. I was also part of multiple committees such as the waste committee, the survey response
							team, and more. It was in these committees I developed a leadership role and optimized workflow.
						</p>

						<h2 class="text-secondary">2009 - 2011</h2>
						<h3>Pizza Hut</h3>
						<h6>Server</h6>
						<p>
							At Pizza Hut, my title was server but that never stopped me from learning more. I was always helping with
							clean up, food prep, making pizzas and handling the occasional customer complaint. I was opening the
							restaurant some days, and closing it others. I treated every customer as if they were my own family and
							always made sure their food was spot on, if not better, than what they were expecting. Working with
							customers has taught me patience and the importance of a quality product in a timely manner. It was one of
							my regular customers that saw my potential and worth who got me a job at PCA.

						<h2 class="text-secondary">2008 - 2009</h2>
						<h3>Variety of Temp Jobs</h3>
						<h6>Farms, Small Factories, Construction, Roofing, Plumbing</h6>
						<p>
							After being discharged from the Navy, I immediately found work doing odd jobs. I've split wood, worked at
							multiple factories through temp agencies, did a little roofing and plumbing, etc... I was learning more
							skills and realizing the drive it requires to be successful in the real world. I learned to never give up
							and never be too humble to work a job.

						<h2 class="text-secondary">2008</h2>
						<h3>United States Navy</h3>
						<h6>
							Discipline, Teamwork, Attention to Detail
						</h6>
						<p>
							I shipped out in June of 2008 and was medically discharged in September of 2008. It was discovered that I
							had a pre-existing heart condition. Though it doesn't affect my physical performance, they said it could
							be a liability down the road. During my brief time in the Navy, I was taught to pay attention to detail
							and to stay focused in a stressful environment. I discovered that I was capable of so much more than what
							I thought I was. I found my limit and pushed passed it.

						<h3>High School</h3>
						<h6>
							Computer Technologies, Science, English, Mathematics, Sports
						</h6>
						<p>
							At Red Creek Central School, I was blessed to have such a broad curriculum. Some of the areas I grew
							passionate about were English, Science, Mathematics, sports, and above all else... Computer Technology. I
							was on the varsity wrestling team for all four years of high school. I am comfortable working with a team
							but i also know that I have to be successful in my own area as well, in order for my team to succeed. In
							my Junior year, I enlisted in the Navy through the Delayed Entry Program. In that one year, I was training
							with Navy Seals and traveling once a month to different locations where I trained and prepared for what I
							thought was to become my new life...
